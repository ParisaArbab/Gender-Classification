# Gender-Classification
1.This code imports various machine learning models (Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Neighbors, and Gaussian Naive Bayes) from scikit-learn, to classify data (height, weight, shoe size) into gender categories (male, female).
2.Each model is trained with the training data (X, Y) and then used to predict gender categories for a new set of data (_X), comparing the predictions against actual categories (_Y) using accuracy score.
3.It compares the accuracy of SVM, KNeighborsClassifier, and Gaussian Naive Bayes models and prints the model with the highest accuracy.
